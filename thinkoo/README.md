# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Setting Up

We will be using EAS for development. To do so, we will be required to install the eas-cli accordingly.

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli

eas login

# Run the command when pushing to the EAS Remote server. 
# Note that due to the absense of Apple Developer Account, we are currently unable to push to the EAS Remote Server for IOS. 
eas init

eas build --profile development --platform android
```

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

### Commands to run project

Step 1: Navigate into the project directory

```bash
cd thinkoo
```

Step 2: Run the project in preferred mode

```bash
npm run android
```

OR

```bash
npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
```

OR

```bash
npm run web
```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
