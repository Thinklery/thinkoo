    question: "What is the Sun mainly made of?",
    options: ["Ice", "Rock", "Hydrogen and helium", "Metal"],
    answer: "Hydrogen and helium",
    explaination:
      "The Sun is not made of rock, ice, or metal. It is actually a massive ball of hot gas, and about 98% of it is hydrogen and helium. Inside the Sun’s core, these gases undergo nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium. This process releases a huge amount of energy — which becomes the sunlight and heat we receive on Earth. Easy to remember: The Sun = a giant glowing hydrogen-and-helium gas lamp powered by fusion.",
